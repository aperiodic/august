August
======

A quick and dirty Dvorak flashcard. 


Usage
-----

To serve August from '0.0.0.0' on your local machine, run `./serve.sh [port]` 
(requires python). The default port is 8000.

Once you've loaded August in a browser, click on a key to fill it out, and hit 
"finished" when done. Errors will be highlighted with red borders, and the 
button will change to a "Reset" button, which clears the card.
